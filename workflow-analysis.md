# Workflow Analysis

## 1. python-package-conda.yml

### Purpose
This workflow is set up for testing Python packages across multiple Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10).

### What it does
1. It runs on pushes to the main branch and pull requests to main
2. It sets up Python environments for each version in the matrix
3. It installs dependencies from requirements.txt
4. It runs linting with flake8
5. It runs tests with pytest

### Do we need this workflow?
- If the project has Python tests that should run on each PR/push, then yes
- If you want to ensure compatibility across multiple Python versions, then yes
- If you don't have pytest tests set up or don't need automated testing, then it's not necessary

### Recommendations
1. Rename the file to python-package-tests.yml since it doesn't use Conda
2. If you don't have pytest tests, either:
   - Remove the workflow
   - Or keep it but remove the pytest step until tests are added
3. If you want to keep it, consider adding a requirements-dev.txt file for development dependencies

## 2. deploy-wiki.yml

### Purpose
This workflow is for deploying GitHub Pages for your wiki.

### Current Issues
The file has indentation errors. The beginning of the file is missing the `name` and `on` sections, and there's incorrect indentation in the `concurrency` section.

### What it should do
1. Build your wiki content from the ./wiki directory using Jekyll
2. Deploy it to GitHub Pages

### Are the action versions good?
The actions used are:
- actions/checkout@v4 (latest version)
- actions/configure-pages@v5 (latest version)
- actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1 (latest version)
- actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3 (latest version)
- actions/deploy-pages@v4 (latest version)

All of these are the latest versions of their respective actions, so they should be good for deploying wiki pages.

### Recommendations
1. Fix the indentation issues
2. Add the missing `name` and `on` sections
3. Consider adding a condition to only run when changes are made to the wiki directory

### Fixed Version
```yaml
name: Deploy Wiki to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'wiki/**'

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false
